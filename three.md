# Rookshot - Chapter Three (of Five)

Things that *need* to happen in this episode:

* Teams register for the clan tournament: ```Melissa, Addison, and Jordan``` and ```Dakota, Mark, Cassandra```

* The nature of Addison and Melissa's relationship is revealed to the audience, and Mark. Optionally, others.

## Scene One

Melissa and Cassandra pop into the "lobby" after the concert. (Cassandra is the musical minion with whom Melissa discussed choosing the song.) Melissa walks over to the computer in the lobby and begins to use it.

[Cassandra] (eager/nagging) Are we going to register for the tourney now?

[Melissa] (annoyed/dismissive) Tournament, and yes.

[Cassandra] (eager/nagging) Who's going to be on our team?

[Melissa] (annoyed/dismissive) Some people.

[Cassandra] (eager/nagging) What people?

[Melissa] (annoyed/dismissive) I don't know yet.

[Cassandra] (waits a bit, unsure of asking the next question) (egaer/nagging) When will you know?

[Melissa] Shut up Cassandra!

Cassandra looks down (maybe sighs?) and pops out. Melissa notices and turns around.

[Melissa] Cassandra?

## Scene Two

Dakota, Mark, and Addison are talking. This picks up shortly after where chapter two left off.

[Mark] The BR doesn't even count.

[Addison] What do you mean it doesn't count? It's a standard gun!

[Mark] Yeh well it's broken; see me with a sniper dude.

[Addison] I have! Last time we played Melissa you emptied a clip her while she jumped in place and missed every shot!

[Mark] My sensitivity was just too high that game, after ~~I changed it~~

[Dakota] No one fucking cares, guys!

[Mark] Stay out of this, Dakota.

An Xbox Live invitation sound interrupts Mark at the end of his line.

[Dakota] Hang on, I got invited somewhere.

[Mark] (mocking) Oh yeh? Are you going to walk out of sight before you accept it so you don't break the fourth wall?

[Dakota] (defensive) No!

Dakota walks around the corner.

Cassandra pops in between Mark and Addison.

[Cassandra] Can I join your team for the tourney?

[Mark] Who the fuck are you? And no one says "tourney".

[Addison] Dude let her talk.

[Mark] Oh gee I'm sorry it didn't notice your shining white armour before, Sir Addison.

[Addison] Oh my god you're twelve.

[Mark] Yeh ~~well~~

[Cassandra] Guys! I need a team.

[Addison] Of course you can join our team.

[Mark] Dude, we don't have room! The tournament takes teams of three you dipshit.

[Addison] Fine! I'll leave.

Addison pops out.

[Mark] Where the hell is he going?

[Cassandra] Probably to Melissa's team. They've been sleeping together for months.

There is a silence between them. Breaking it, Mark turns to Cassandra.

[Mark] What?

## Scene Three

Dakota pops into a the end of a long line into a doorway. He begins a conversation with the person in front of him.

[Dakota] Where is this?

[Person in Line] The DMV.

[Dakota] What?

[Person in Line] Ha! Nah just kidding. It's the line to register for the tourney.

[Dakota] Tourney? No I meant to register for the tournament.

[Person in Line] Oh that's here too.

Someone ahead in line scream-gargles and runs out of place, killing themselves with a spike grenade. No one is phased, and people take a step forward.

[Person in Line] Oh sweet the line's moving.

## Scene Four

Melissa is alone back in the "lobby".

[Melissa] Jordan!

Jordan pops in, confused.

[Jordan] How do you keep doing this?

[Melissa] You need a team for the clan tournament, don't you?

[Jordan] Well, actually, I was entering with some friends.

[Melissa] What friends?

[Jordan] xXDigitalPh33rXx5 and MikSpartan, why?

Melissa looks up, implying she is doing something else.

[Jordan] Hey why did they both go offline!

[Melissa] Not important! The important part is, you need a team, and I need a member.

Addison pops in.

[Addison] What kind of member?

[Melissa] Addison! What are you doing here?

[Addison] Mark was being an ass so I'm joining your team for the tourney.

[Melissa] Good then! It's settled, the three of us, with me as captain. I'm going to register us!

Melissa pops out, leaving Addison and Jordan alone together in silence.

[Addison] So....

[Jordan] (quickly) What?

## Scene Five

Melissa pops into line behind Dakota at the registrar.

[Melissa] Hey Dakota!

[Dakota] Hello Melissa.

[Melissa] When was the last time the line moved?

[Dakota] When some guy gave up and killed himself.

[Melissa] I see. (war cry)

Melissa gets her own slaughter-filled action scene of killing ever person in line and in the registrar building aside from one employee behind the desk.

[Desk] Names?

[Melissa] Melissa, Addison, and Jordan.

[Desk] ID numbers have been messaged to you. Have your team reply with their ID numbers and ~~names. Be sure to have your team members reply with the correct ID number.~~

Melissa pops out, done listening. The Desk continues in the background as Dakota makes his way through the rubble.

[Dakota] (navigating corpses) So sorry. Really sorry about this. She didn't mean it personally.

[Desk] Next.

[Dakota] That's me!

Dakota makes his way to the desk, but Mark pops in ahead of him, at the desk.

[Desk] Names?

[Mark] Mark, Dakota, Cassandra.

Desk begins spewing the same line, but audio is overridden by Dakota and Mark.

[Dakota] Cassandra? What are you talking about?

[Mark] I'll explain later; come with me.

Both of them pop out. The Desk's audio returns to normal volume, accompanied by shots of the empty building filled with Melissa's carnage.

[Desk] ...correct name.

Silence & shots of carnage.

[Desk] Next.

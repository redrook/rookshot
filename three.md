# Rookshot - Chapter Three (of Five)

Things that *need* to happen in this episode:

* Teams register for the clan tournament: ```Melissa, Addison, and Jordan``` and ```Dakota, Mark, Cassandra```

* The nature of Addison and Melissa's relationship is revealed to the audience, and Mark. Optionally, others.

## Scene One

Melissa and Cassandra pop into the "lobby" after the concert. (Cassandra is the musical minion with whom Melissa discussed choosing the song.) Melissa walks over to the computer in the lobby and begins to use it.

[Cassandra] \(eager/nagging) Are we going to register for the tourney now?

[Melissa] \(annoyed/dismissive) Tournament, and yes.

[Cassandra] \(eager/nagging) Who's going to be on our team?

[Melissa] \(annoyed/dismissive) Some people.

[Cassandra] \(waits a bit, unsure of asking the next question) (egaer/nagging) What people?

[Melissa] Shut up Cassandra!

Cassandra looks down (maybe sighs?) and pops out. Melissa notices and turns around.

[Melissa] Cassandra?

## Scene Two

Dakota, Mark, and Addison are talking. This picks up shortly after where chapter two left off.

[Mark] The BR doesn't even count.

[Addison] What do you mean it doesn't count? It's a standard gun!

[Mark] Yeh well it's broken; see me with a sniper dude.

[Addison] I have! Last time we played Melissa you emptied a clip her while she jumped in place and missed every shot!

[Mark] My sensitivity was just too high that game, after ~~I changed it~~

[Dakota] No one fucking cares, guys!

[Mark] Stay out of this, Dakota.

An Xbox Live invitation sound interrupts Mark at the end of his line.

[Dakota] Hang on, I got invited somewhere.

Dakota pops out.

Cassandra pops in between Mark and Addison.

[Cassandra] Can I join your team for the tourney?

[Mark] Who the fuck are you? And no one says "tourney".

[Addison] Dude let her talk.

[Mark] Oh gee I'm sorry it didn't notice your shining white armour before, Sir Addison.

[Addison] Oh my god you're twelve.

[Mark] Yeh ~~well~~

[Cassandra] Guys! I need a team.

[Addison] Of course you can join our team.

[Mark] Dude, we don't have room! The tournament takes teams of three you dipshit.

[Addison] Fine! I'll leave.

Addison pops out.

[Mark] Where the hell is he going?

[Cassandra] Probably to Melissa's team. They've been sleeping together for months.

There is a silence between them. Breaking it, Mark turns to Cassandra.

[Mark] What?

## Scene Three

Dakota pops into a the end of a long line into a doorway. He begins a conversation with the person in front of him.

[Dakota] Where is this?

[Person in Line] The DMV.

[Dakota] What?

[Person in Line] Ha! Nah just kidding. It's the line to register for the tourney.

[Dakota] Tourney? No I meant to register for the tournament.

[Person in Line] Oh that's here too.

Someone ahead in line scream-gargles and runs out of place, killing themselves with a spike grenade. No one is phased, and people take a step forward.

[Person in Line] Oh sweet the line's moving.

## Scene Four

Melissa is alone back in the "lobby".

[Melissa] Jordan!

Jordan pops in, confused.

[Jordan] Who are you?

[Melissa] You need a team for the clan tournament, don't you?

[Jordan] Well, actually, I was entering with some friends.

[Melissa] What friends?

[Jordan] xXDigitalPh33rXx5 and MikSpartan, why?

Melissa looks up, implying she is doing something else.

[Jordan] Hey why did they both go offline!

[Melissa] Not important! The important part is, you need a team, and I need a member.

Addison pops in.

[Addison] What kind of member?

[Melissa] Addison! What are you doing here?

[Addison] Mark was being an ass so I'm joining your team for the tourney.

[Melissa] Good then! It's settled, the three of us, with me as captain. I'm going to register us!

Melissa pops out, leaving Addison and Jordan alone together in silence.

[Jordan] \(quickly) What?

## Scene Five

Melissa pops into line behind Dakota at the registrar.

[Melissa] Hey Dakota!

[Dakota] Hello Melissa.

[Melissa] When was the last time the line moved?

[Dakota] When some guy gave up and killed himself.

A spartan walks around the corner of the building to announce that the registration is full.

[Announcer] I'm sorry everyone, but the registration is closed; both the tournament and tourney have a full roster. You don't have to go home, but you can't ~~stay here.~~

[Guy in Line 1] Yeh we know the joke, asshole.

[Guy in Line 2] Let's get froxen yogurt.

Both guys in line pop out, along with everyone else besides Dakota and Melissa.

[Dakota] This sucks!

[Melissa] Don't worry, we'll be in the tournament.

[Dakota] What? How?

[Melissa] Let me and my team handle that. You get your team and station the back of the registrar building. Let me know if anyone's coming.

[Dakota] Uh. Ok. (runs off)

Addison and Jordan spawn in by Melissa.

[Melissa] Addison, get inside that building and quietly find the registration computer. Jordan, get some explosives.

[Addison] On it. (runs around the building)

[Jordan] Where am I supposed to find explosives?

[Melissa] Oh, I don't know, maybe that huge pile of nuclear fusion coils? (camera pan to pile)

[Jordan] \(suspended disbelief/resignation) Right. Of course, the pile of nuclear fusion coils. (runs to pile)

## Scene Six

Dakota, Mark, and Cassandra are at the back of the registrar building.

[Dakota] Addison what?

[Mark] He quit. But it's ok, she joined. (nods to Cassandra)

[Cassandra] Hey!

[Dakota] Uh..hey.

[Cassandra] What are we doing here?

[Dakota] I, uh. We're supposed to guard this building and--

[Mark] Just humor him Cassandra, he's in roleplaying.

[Dakota] I am not! Melissa told me to do it.

[Mark] Oh ok, so it's like S&M.

Dakota stares at Mark.

## Scene Seven

Jordan, and Melissa are at the registrar door with fusion coils piled up.

[Jordan] Ready!

Melissa fires, and knocks the door down.

[Melissa] Head in!

They enter and fire (cameras will appear to be depicting one side of a fight scene), then finding it is just a two story empty room with a computer in the corner, where Addison is standing.

[Addison] Yeh it's kind of lame inside.

[Melissa] Did you register us?

[Addison] Yep, and Dakota's team too.

[Jordan] Who did you unregister to fit us in?

[Addison] I didn't look actually.

[Jordan] Oh.

[Melissa] Let's head to the training arena.

The three of them pop out.

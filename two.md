# Rookshot - Chapter Two

Map: Foundry

## Scene One

Mark and Dakota spawn (in that order) in an MLG forged map on Foundry. Mark leads Dakota around it.

[Dakota] What is this?

[Mark] A map Melissa forged.

[Dakota] Melissa forges?

[Mark] Yeh dude. She made all the competitive maps back when Halo 3 was on the MLG circuit.

[Dakota] Seriously?

[Mark] Yep. And I'm going to destroy her reputation by putting a shitty map out in her name. I'm taking us to a canvas.

Mark and Dakota pop out of game simultaneously.

Addison pops in shortly after.

[Addison] Hey guys I had to change my NAT setti--guys?

## Scene Two

### Part One

Mark and Dakota are in a Foundry canvas map. Mark is using his gun to melee one last crate in to place. It is a square of crates with an opening in the middle, filled with spawn points.

[Mark] {giddy} It's a shitty masterpiece! Everyone's going to hate it!

[Dakota] {sarcastic} Aren't you a craftsman.

Something moves in the tunnels in the back of Foundry and Dakota notices it.

[Dakota] I think there's someone else here.

[Mark] {distracted by admiring his crates} Huh? No it's a closed game.

[Dakota] You mean you locked the door?

[Mark] {sigh} Yeh. I locked the door.

### Part Two

Melissa walks out to the open area of the canvas behind Dakota and Mark.

[Melissa] I should have known you'd try something like this Mark.

[Mark] {turns around; disbelief} Melissa?

[Melissa] No one forges on Halo 3 anymore anyway. Bungie doesn't even host maps. There's nowhere for you to put it out.

[Mark] {thinking he is witty} What you know about putting out?

[Dakota] {whisper} Dude I thought you told me you guys had sex?

[Mark] {whisper} Uhm, yeh, we did.

[Dakota] {whisper} Hmm.

[Mark] {whisper; angry} Why did you start talking to her in the first place?

[Dakota] {whisper} She was the only one I knew who played Halo 3!

[Mark] {whisper}  Well maybe you wouldn't run into these problems {no longer whispering} if you played a *modern fucking video game*.

While their conversation went on Melissa looked around bored.

[Melissa] Because you're such a slow learner Mark, I'm going to teach you this lesson in song.

[Mark] {to Dakota; disbelief} Did she just say she was going to sing?

[Dakota] I--I think so.

### Part Three

[Melissa] Minions! Come forth!

[Mark] {rising disbelief} Minions?

[Melissa] Just a bunch of middle schoolers who worship my K/D.

Two default colored spartans pop in to either side of Melissa, and kneel.

[Minion 1] We are at your service my lad--

The teammate from the previous episode spawns in, running with the flag, but stops and looks around.

[Teammate] I'm almost there! They're flanking the--wait. Where am I?

[Melissa] No not you!

[Teammate] Huh?

The teammate despawns.

[Melissa] Minions, build me a stage.

[Minion 1] Yes, my lady.

Both minions run off the corner and begin moving things around by meleeing them.

[Melissa] Musical Minions, come forth!

Three default colored spartans spawn around Melissa, and kneel.

[Musical Minion 1] We sing to show our love for you, my lady.

[Melissa] Prepare song 37!

[Musical Minion 2] {rises} The old 37 or the new 37?

[Melissa] What?

[Musical Minion 2] You had us throw out song 32 after the accident, so everything is shifted. Do you want the 37 that was once 38, or the 37 that is now 36?

[Melissa] It's--it's the one with the piano.

Musical Minion 2 looks up as if in his HUD.

[Musical Minion 2] Let's see... {sound of pages flipping} ah yes! Piano, songs 2, 16, 36 and 37 have piano.

[Melissa] {annoyed} The one that sounds like Adele.

[Musical Minion 2] Found it! That's 36, the old 37. Ok Minions let's  cover the stage!

All three minions run toward the stage, and two other minions are still working on it in the back.

Melissa walks toward the stage as well, as the instrumental introduction becomes louder. A minions covers the "drums" and the "piano" and there is a microphone stand for Melissa.

### Part Four

[Mark] What the fuck is going on?

[Dakota] I {pause} have no idea.

Addison spawns in beside them.

[Addison] Finally! What are you guys doing?

Dakota and Addison both just look at him.

[Addison] What's that sound?

## Scene Three

Scene three is the music video portion, which will depend on the lyrics. Jacob has the initial commit for this.

Actually Jacob already made the initial commit for this. Lyrics below.

You told me that you rocked in bed
That you were great at games and had tons of friends
But we both know that this isn't true
And now I'm ashamed I ever dated you

Douchebag, your collar's popped so high
I'd love to kill you, but it looks like you already died
(he could be like “no I didn't” and then immediately gets killed by her)

[Mark] No I didn't.
Mark gets sniped by Melissa.

I hate to pop into your lobby uninvited
But I just had to say, I'm feeling slighted
You play my favorite game, and now I am reminded
That I can do so much better

[Mark] Seriously, are you finished?

Never will, I date someone like you
I wish nothing but the worst for you too
I won't forgive you, or beg
And I told all of my friends
Sometimes it lasts in love, but you never did in bed
Sometimes it lasts in love, but you never did in bed

Things to include

* A crowd of minions with charged energy pistols waving them like candles yelling praise at Melissa.

* A lot of minions chasing Addison, and Addison being frustrated. Minions will not bother Mark or Dakota.

## Scene Four

Mark, Dakota, and Addison are left alone after Melissa and her minions leave.

[Mark] She is so into me.

[Dakota] Are you fucking dense?

[Mark] Nope, just handsome, great at sex, video games, and being awesome in general.

[Dakota] Is that it?

[Mark] Well, it is for the short list at least.

[Addison] Dude, you suck at Halo, she killed you while she was singing a song.

[Mark] Yeah, but that's because I was adjusting my sensitivity, it was way too high.
